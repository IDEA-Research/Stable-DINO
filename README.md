# :dragon_face: Stable DINO

Code will be available soon! Stay tuned!

## :bulb: Highlight
- **High performance.** Maybe the strongest object detector.
- **Easy to use.** Only a few lines of code to be modified on [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO).
- **Lightweight.** Nearly no extra cost during training and inference compared with [DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/DINO).
